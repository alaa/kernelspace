I have seen many start-up founders creating their e-hell projects rather than
building thier own start-up project. The worst part is thier statsfying
excuse is always they want to build things quickly and move fast! and fix/optimize 
later. They don't care about technology stack, development methodologies & practices 
nor setting up a basic infrastrcuture.

As I remember from the IT Project management unit at my university,
A software prototyping phase gives a green-light to build things fast.
Participating in a 3-days hackathon competitions would be
software prototyping too.

But having a start-up investment and a team, does not mean the CTO
has a Green-light to build messed-up stuff and break all the rules
for the sake of the so-called productivity. Why? because that is wrong!
CTOs who think they have ANY OF THE FOLLOWING charactaristcs should stop
thier development right now and re-evaluate their decisions:

1. Not beleiving in any of the exsisting frameworks because they can write simpler things.
2. Thinking that writing SQL statments is more hacker-ish!.
3. Loving to do things fast, so no time to learn/do unit tests.
4. Loving configuring servers by SSHing into them becuase they are hackers.
5. Thinking that automation is only for giants but not for small things.
6. Thinking about using GIT in the future.
7. Thinking that Cloud is all about creating AWS AMIs for later scalability with ELBs.
