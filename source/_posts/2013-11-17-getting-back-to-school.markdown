“Real world job makes you rusty” - Unknown 

I read this quote somewhere, probably on twitter, and since that time I started thinking, why would real work makes us rusty. shouldn’t it make us write code faster and perform systems operations in a more practical way? it did not make sense to me at that time. 

After few weeks I got my first interview with Google, and I started brushing up on many subjects for the interview preparation. At this point I realized how many important subjects I buried because of the real world work.

When was the last time we had to think about Mathematics, Data Structures or BTree, Graph, or even a sort algorithm? In reality many engineers wouldn’t really need to think about it after having all these smart tools, databases, search and indexing engines. Because we simply need to be productive and use libraries and run services and it will just work.

Well, not precisely!, because after starting reading the “Basics of computing” again I started seeing how things work in a different way. and understanding the underneath layer of things. which is an unvaluable way of thinking.

Now I am getting back to school. to teach myself back everything that I have buried or missed.
