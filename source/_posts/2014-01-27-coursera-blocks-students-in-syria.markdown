Coursera blocks students in Syria from learning online instead of teaching the regime what democracy is. 
This all what it takes to kill any remaining hope for a young girl/boy
trying to learning during the current mess in thier country. 

Well, In case you did not know. The Syrian regime is really busy
terminating the population, I can assure you that they are not willing to
study Algorithms, Machine learning or Music!. The regime is stupid enough to learn anyway.

I am not writing this to discuss politics, I just want the education to
reach everybody who wants to learn.
