Coursera has blocked Syrian students from learning online instead of teaching the regime what democracy is. 
That is a huge fail. Countries could not help the Syrian revolution, so they decided not to help in Education as well.
Oh, and just for your information, the regime will never learn programming, machine learning or algorithms on
coursera, only the young generation would love to learn that, and
Coursera has blocked them from free learning.

Congrats!
