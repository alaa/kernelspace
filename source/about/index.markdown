My name is Alaa Qutaish
I hold a Bachelor in Computing from University of Greenwich, I worked in
both Software Development and Systems Engineering. Now I am holding a
position in Software Systems which is a bridge between these two worlds.

I believe that Software Systems is the base for building solutions, and
for understanding how technologies should work together in order to get
the maximum benifit out of it.
